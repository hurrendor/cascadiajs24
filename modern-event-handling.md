title: Modern Event Handling
desc: 'Sick of nested and clunky addEventListener() calls? Want a functional, declarative way of handling events in JavaScript? Chrome engineer Dominic Farolino introduces the long-awaited Observable API, a composable event handling primitive to replace addEventListener() coming to a browser near you!

Native Observables do for streams of events what Promises did for callbacks & callback hell. Frameworks have long used them to declaratively create pipelines of operators through which events flow, and the Web is finally getting them natively. Observable API is the most wanted web standards proposal on GitHub by developers, and in this talk you'll learn how to listen to events with an Observable, use operators to transform & listen to multiple events, and even build your own Observables from scratch!'
