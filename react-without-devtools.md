title: React without Devtools
desc: 'React DevTools today help find slow components in your React app. But Devtools are complicated to use: we insert profile everything, catch some promising leads, but nothing happens before time runs out. Eventually, the slow/buggy code never gets fixed, problems pile up on a backlog, and our end users are hurt.

But what if we could find these issues... automatically? In this talk weâ€™ll discover Million Lint, and how we can use compilers that let you do exactly that.'
