## Embedding accessibility starts with fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.
Recognizing the imppact that diversity and inclusion can have on our web experience.

## Diverse teams build better products
Diverse teams build with different considerations by filling knowledge gaps and creating products that can reach more people.

"When we build for people like us, we often exclude people who are not like us."
Disability is a direct result of the design choices we make when we don't take the diversity of humanity into account.

Disability exists on a spectrum, ranging from permanent, temporary and situational.

## Technology can create disabilities
### Electrical usage 
How much power does your product use?
(whatdoesmysitecost.com){}
### Device Speed & Capabilities
Screen resolution, interactive methods, contrast issues, are the users outside?

## Learning & Growing are key
By learning, we can grow to value our differences in making a more accessible product.

## Talk about accessibility as a market opportunity
By recognizing diversity, we can reach more people. Making things unaccessible to users is cutting our market.

## Change takes time, but it's worth it
Adding accessibility post-build cost more time and resources than building it at the beginning.

## Reactionary accessibility approach
Accessibility issues mainly are unaddressed until something bad happens, like a need that surfaces at user support or a lawsuit. Tracking the financial burden can showcase the baseline cost of other approaches.

## Holistic accessibility approach
Embedding accessibility earlier in the process can help us catch issues. The best time is in the planning phase, and the next best time is in the design experience.

# TLDR
Shift accessibility earlier in the process. Identify potential barriers earlier on.
## Accessibility is a journey, not a destination.
