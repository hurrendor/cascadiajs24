title: Lost and Found
desc: 'The past decade in web development has often been characterized as a "lost decade" for modern JavaScript, marked by fragmentation and shifting paradigms. Meanwhile, serverless architectures have quietly grown more capable and influential. This talk examines the dual evolution of JavaScript frameworks and serverless technologies, highlighting the challenges and triumphs of each. We'll discuss how serverless has matured to become a cornerstone of scalable, efficient backend solutions, and how modern JavaScript has navigated its turbulent journey.'
