## Improving the GIF Experience
Existing GIF attributes
Animated, Silent, Looping, inline, autoplay
### Adding items to the checklist of needs
#### Text alternatives
    - Provide `alt` text descriptions for images used!
    - Write alt text like you're talking to a friend 

#### Higher Quality, Smaller Size
Use modern file types like WebP, AVIF to provide higher quality while reducing the size of the file.

##### Other options (libraries): 
sharp, libvips, gif2webp, FFmpeg, lmageMagick 

##### Services:
- Cloudinary (Biased Link)[cloudfour.com/make]


### Motion preferences
Default to a static image asset to provide non-animated versions for user preferences

### Playback control
Give users individualized control by providing the 
`<video control>` attribute. Changing GIF to video file types is comparable in size.    
Attributes like `<video control autoplay loop muted playinline>`
#### Alt Text on Playback
- Use the HTML <figure>and <figcaption> elements
- Use an aria-label combined with the controls attribute
- Use aria-labelledby={elementID} and a combined div or other HTML element container to capture the alt text

#### Motion preferences
Use Web Components to
- check the media query using `window.matchMedia`
