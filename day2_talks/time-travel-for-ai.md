### 3 Types of Technologists
1. Keeping up with every tech trend.
2. Confident in skillset and unwilling to learn new trends.
3. Informed on industry changes, but only adopts new tech when it aligns with work or interests.

## GitHub Copilot 
Output will be non-deterministic - unpredictable results.
Prompt engineering to elicit an AI model for more accurate result.

### Tips to use it better:
1. Put a very large comment with lots of context
2. Iterate for specificity
Computers can only do what you tell them to do
3. Keep a tab or two open in your editor to give Copilot context

### Training AI models
- zero-shot learning - expected to make predictions without having used the information previously
- one shot learning - make predicitions after one run through information
- few shot learning - make predictions after a few runs of information
