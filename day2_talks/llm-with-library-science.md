-------------------------------------------------

### Key Themes
- Use of large language models (LLMs) in workflow
- Applying information literacy models to enhance AI interactions
- Practical implementation of the Big Six model in AI prompts
- Managing AI hallucinations with structured prompts

### Detailed Notes

#### Introduction to Topic
- **Speaker's Context:** Discusses the impact of large language models (LLMs) on personal workflow since 2022.
- **Favorite Show Reference:** Mentions "Westworld" and its concept of hosts (synthetic beings) entering an introspective analysis state, drawing a parallel to using AI for deep analysis.

#### Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **Workflow Integration:** LLMs are used primarily for generating and testing code.
- **Diverse Applications:** Beyond coding, LLMs assist in gathering information and answering questions on various topics.

#### Problem of AI Hallucinations
- **Challenge:** AI-generated outputs can sometimes be incorrect or misleading (hallucinations).
- **Need for Structured Approach:** Seeking methods to improve accuracy and reliability of AI outputs.

#### The Big Six Information Literacy Model
- **Origin:** Created by Dr. Michael Eisenberg and Bob Berkowitz in 1988.
- **Components:**
  1. **Task Definition:** Define the problem and identify information needs.
  2. **Information Seeking Strategies:** Determine possible sources and select the best ones.
  3. **Location and Access:** Find sources and access information within them.
  4. **Use of Information:** Read, listen, view, and extract relevant information.
  5. **Synthesis:** Organize information to create a product or answer.
  6. **Evaluation:** Judge the product's effectiveness and the process.

#### Applying the Big Six to AI Prompts
- **Blueprint Technique:** Structuring AI prompts based on the Big Six model to guide information retrieval and synthesis.
  - Example: Generating an explanation for the factors leading to the Hundred Years' War using the Big Six steps.
- **Reflective Analysis:** Using follow-up prompts to review and refine AI-generated outputs based on the Big Six framework.
  - Example: Asking for an analysis of ecological debates using the Big Six to structure the response.

#### Benefits of the Big Six Model
- **Higher Quality Outputs:** Structuring prompts with the Big Six can lead to more accurate and coherent AI responses.
- **Reduced Hallucinations:** Encourages logical progression and thoroughness, reducing the likelihood of incorrect information.

#### Practical Demonstrations
- **Blueprint Technique:** Demonstrates using ChatGPT to apply the Big Six model to historical research questions.
- **Reflective Analysis:** Shows how follow-up prompts can refine AI outputs for better clarity and accuracy.

#### Broader Implications
- **Everyday Users:** Simplifying the Big Six model for everyday use in AI interactions.
- **Academics and Developers:** Potential for integrating the Big Six model into AI training and instructional design.
- **Contrast Prompting:** Research supports using contrast prompts (providing both right and wrong answers) to improve AI accuracy, aligning with the structured approach of the Big Six.

#### Conclusion
- **Call to Action:** Encourages further exploration and application of the Big Six model in AI development and usage.
- **Resources Provided:** Links to additional research and a customized ChatGPT interface with the Big Six model integrated.

Running 'Analysis Mode' with LLMs

## The Big 6
Information based problem-solving model (the Eisenberg-Berkowitz model, 1988)
Goal: Guide individuals in effective research, problem-solving, and decision making

## The Big 6 Process Model
1. Task Definition
2. Information Seeking STrategies
Determine all possible sources, and select the best ones
3. Location and Access
4. Use of Information
5. Synthesis
6. Evaluation
Judge the product's status and efficacy 

## Application of the Big 6 in LLMs
Using this as a template in LLMs to 'blueprint'
First prompt - `Use the Big 6 process model...`
Followup prompt - Instruct the chatbot to analyze its previous output using the Big 6 process model

## The Ariadne Hypothesis
Ariadne - Greek goddess of mazes and labyrinths
Blueprinting can reduce hallucinations by constricting the LLM creativity.

## Contrast Prompting
Prompting the LLM to generate both correct and incorrect answers. Using reflective based contrasting can
