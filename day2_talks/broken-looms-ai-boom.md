Moving to replace human effort with automation is not a novel effort.

### 1. Don't assume inevitability
Assuming certain outcomes can become a self-fulfilling prophecy

### 2. Protect your craft
When you use AI/automation, is it helping you learn and understand your craft?

### 3. Ask who benefits
Should this feature really have AI? Does this help our users?
