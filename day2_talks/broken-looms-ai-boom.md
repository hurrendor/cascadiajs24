### Key Themes
- Intersection of coding and textile work
- Historical context of industrialization and its parallels to modern technology
- Impact of automation on labor
- Personal reflections on the future of work

Moving to replace human effort with automation is not a novel effort.

## Key takeaways

### 1. Don't assume inevitability
Assuming certain outcomes can become a self-fulfilling prophecy

### 2. Protect your craft
When you use AI/automation, is it helping you learn and understand your craft?

### 3. Ask who benefits
Should this feature really have AI? Does this help our users?

### Detailed Notes

#### Intersection of Coding and Textile Work
- **Learning Skills:** The speaker discusses how learning to code and sew expanded their understanding and challenged their perceived intellectual limits.
- **Valuation of Skills:** There is a disparity in how coding and textile work are valued, with textile work often being undervalued and predominantly done by women.

#### Historical Context of Industrialization
- **Textile Workers:** 60-80% of global textile workers are women, often earning below a livable wage.
- **Software Engineers:** Highly paid, with only 8% of engineers globally being women, though this number is higher in the U.S. at 28%.

#### Technological Advances in Textiles
- **Historical Innovations:**
  - **Spinning Jenny:** Early spinning machine powered by water, reducing the need for skilled labor.
  - **Power Loom:** Automated weaving, leading to significant changes in the textile industry and labor force.
- **Labor Movements:**
  - **Luddite Uprising:** Textile workers protested against machinery that threatened their jobs, smashing machines they deemed harmful.

#### Parallels to Modern Technology
- **AI and Automation:** 
  - **GitHub Copilot:** An AI tool that assists in coding, analogous to historical tools that automated textile work.
  - **AI Risks:** Similar fears of job replacement and the need to balance automation with skill development.
- **Punch Card Technology:** Used in Jacquard looms and later in early computers, showing the long-standing connection between textiles and computing.

#### Impact of Automation on Labor
- **Labor Displacement:** Automation historically displaced skilled labor, often replaced by low-paid, unskilled workers.
- **Current Examples:**
  - **Amazon’s Automation Goals:** Aspires to fully automate warehouses, reminiscent of Babbage’s vision of a human-free factory.
  - **Hidden Labor:** Modern automation can obscure the labor that still exists, such as low-paid workers supporting AI systems.

#### Personal Reflections on the Future of Work
- **Learning and Automation:**
  - The speaker values using AI tools for familiar tasks but emphasizes the importance of learning and understanding new skills independently.
- **Ethical Considerations:**
  - **Corporate Decisions:** Questions whether new features serve users or are driven by shareholder interests.
  - **Global Implications:** Encourages awareness of the global impact of technological advances, including the hidden labor that supports it.

#### Lessons from the Luddites
- **Avoiding Inevitability:** The Luddites fought for their way of life, demonstrating that outcomes are not predetermined and can be influenced by resistance.
- **Protecting Craft:** Balancing the use of AI tools with skill development to ensure personal growth and understanding.
- **Questioning Automation:** Encourages critical thinking about the true benefits and costs of automation for both workers and users.

### Conclusion
- **Human Element:** Emphasizes the importance of retaining the human element in both coding and textile work.
- **Active Engagement:** Encourages active engagement in discussions about the future of work and the ethical use of technology.
- **Historical Awareness:** Draws parallels between past and present to highlight ongoing issues in labor and technology.
