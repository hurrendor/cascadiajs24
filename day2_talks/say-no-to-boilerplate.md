title: 'Say No to Boilerplate: Building Apps with v0 & DataStax'
desc: 'Forget about boilerplate! We'll show the magic of Vercel's v0.dev, an AI-powered UI generation tool that lets you describe your dream interface and watch it come to life.

But power doesn't stop at the UI! We'll also dive into DataStax's vector database capabilities designed to handle complex data types and enable lightning-fast, AI-powered searches â€“ perfect for building intelligent features like image recognition or personalized recommendations.
I hope to teach you two things:
How to Drastically Reduce Development Time: Say goodbye to endless lines of boilerplate code and focus on building what matters most.
Effortlessly Integrate AI Features: Unleash the power of AI search and vector databases to add intelligence to your applications with minimal effort.'

## RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation
- No model training.
- Provide information / context in a vector database.
- Less data required, efficient, data quality dependence.
Good use cases: Tech support, personalized learning, customer chatbots
(Code example)[rscgpt.vercel.app]


## (v0.dev)[https://v0.dev/]
- Create UIs with AI.
- Abilities to create new projects, work with different libraries.
- Versioning, scaffolding

## Fine Tuning
- Training a model
- task specific optimization 
- able to handle nuances
- resource intensive
Providing prompts
Good use cases: Medical diagnosis, financial forecasting, custo copywriting

## Vercel's AI SDK

(Vercel AI playground)[https://sdk.vercel.ai/]

## Entity Resolution
Combining information about an entity from different sources to prevent duplicate information.
Resolving entities aides in maintaining/ scaling RAG systems as they evolve.
