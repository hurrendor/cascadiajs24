title: Putting Fun Back into Coding
desc: 'Web development doesn't need to be an exhausting race to keep up on every new tool or idea. Despite the whirlwind of FoMO and hot takes that shout over many online spaces for developers, that's not the only way to stay relevant and keep growing as a developer. In this talk, Jason Lengstorf will share his approach to learning and growing in a way that's fun, sustainable, and arguably more effective. Along the way, you'll see the kinds of projects Jason builds for fun and examine how each one might appear useless, but actually drove very real learning and career growth.'

Work is 36% of your waking life (assuming you sleep 8 hours a night)

### Steps to a good career in tech
1. Learn tech skills
2. Get a tech job
3. Minimize voluntary suffering

### Philosophy break 
I don't get to choose what happens outside of my control.
But I do get to choose if I let it make me miserable.

### In a professional environment, what is fun?
Venn diagram of 
- Challenge
- Exploration (What little adventures can I do?)
- Connection (Sharing and collaborating with friends/colleagues)


### Philosophy break 
Your career is a pie-eating contest where the prize for winning is more pie.
Be extremely clear about what kind of pie you like.

Volunteer for projects that go in the direction that you want to go. 
With the luxury of spare time, build projects to share what you would like to do.

`Build silly shit just for fun.`
Play makes us better at learning!

Silly projects give us good opportunities to review what we've learned.
Silly, fun projects can land you professional projects.
Silly, personal projects can help build a wonderful, inclusive community.

### Fun is not the opposite of hard work.
"Level of enjoyment" and "Level of effort" are different things.
